SQL Database 

1. Create a databse and test for methods that INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and SELECT items from said database.

2. I created a Drive DB that had a table of cars characterized by brand and model.

3. Running the tests and checking the Drive DB confirms that the data is and can be manipulated through this app.
